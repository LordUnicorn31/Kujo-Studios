## Description

In a distant future, humans have raided planets for centuries. They land, raid any mineral they can gather, and leave. 

You are the captain of one of the spaceships responsible for performing such tasks, but an asteroid left your crew stranded at an unknown planet.

Explore an unfamiliar world, mine its resources and fly away with all you can in this RTS adventure!

## Key Features

 - Exploration: Featuring map randomization, every time you play you'll need to explore a different planet!
 - Resource and Troop management: Gather as many resources as you can to escape, while defending yourself from the enemy.
 - Strategy: Pick your fights wisely! Your objective is not to exterminate the enemy, but to escape the planet.
 - Gamepad + Keyboard and mouse supported!
