Game design:
The game starts with the starship in the centre of the screen.You are allowed to build a gold mine and a mineral mine if there are mines nearby. 
From then with the gold and mineral you receive you are allowed to build a weapon industry. The weapon industry is usefull to create weapons for your soldiers.
Now, thanks to the improvement of building a weapon industry now you are allowed to build barracks to recruit units. Now that you are allowed to recruit soldiers you are able to build a
special units industry (e.g: tanks, special cannons).
