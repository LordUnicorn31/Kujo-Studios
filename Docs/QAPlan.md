# Quality Assurance Plan
## Overview
Here we will show the Quality Assurance Plan we are following during the development of the project, to ensure the creation of a clean and well-designed game.

## Tools
The same Github Issues will be used for reporting bugs during the development, by using some parameters given below. The parameters will describe the impact on the gameplay, the level of urgency to fix it to continue more comfortable with the project, and how often it occurs; and accompained by a description of the bug, and the expected result to happen.

## Bug Parameters
### Impact on Gameplay
- SH(Super High): Game unplayable or not running.
- H(High): Game playable for a certain time, then breaks or becomes unplayable.
- M(Medium): Game playable but not as expected.
- L(Low): Static visual or audio related.
### Urgency
- SH: It needs to be fixed the same moment; it blocks the progress of the project.
- H: It needs to be fixed before a day, it doesn't block the progress but makes it harder.
- M: It needs to be fixed before a week, it doesn't block the progres at all.
- L: It will be fixed when all other problems are fixed.
### Frequency
- SH: It happens every time the game is played.
- H: It happens regularly, but not everytime.
- M: It happens some times, easy to avoid.
- L: It happens under some special conditions, harldy ever.

Then, we have to add some information that we consider important.

### How to report bugs
Start pressing "New Issue" button on github. 
In the title we will write a name to identify the bug, then in brackets we will introduce the parameters given beyond respecting the same order and separated by commas.
For ending, we will write the respective descriptions as comments.

- Title: BugName(Impact on Gameplay, Urgency, Frequency)
- Comment: Descriptions required

Example:  
- GameBreaksEverytime(SH, SH, SH)
- Actual description. Excpected description.
          
## Milestones Delivery Protocol
### External
- April 22nd: **Vertical Slice**          
- May 19th: **Alpha**
- June First Week: **Gold**

A week before every milestone the whole team will take a session of intensive playtesting in order to identify the major number of bugs and problems possible to fix it during the last week before the milestone. After these session, the team will decide the needed improvements and the priority of each in order to get a solid and clean build. There will be performed few Quality Tests too, in charge of the QA manager and with the whole team deciding who is going to test the game, it has to be someone external to the team.

### Internal
Every thursday morning will take place a playtesting session with the whole team. It will be focused to the objectives of this week, in order to identify and solve, if it is possible at this moment, all the problems created during the development and making easier to continue with the project comfortably.

## Processes for QA and Quality Tests
---
### QA
#### Internal
Testing sessions will last for about 30 minutes and are performed by a member of the group. The goal is to identify, report and solve if it is possible the major number of issues in the game.
After the testing session, the whole team will spent the next 30 minutes to find ways to solve the problems found and to distribute the members who will work in solving them.
The total duration of the session is 1 hour.
To perform tests when there is a external milestone delivery soon, the whole team will perform the test for the same amount of time to ensure a bigger efficiency.

#### External
Exactly the same process as internal tests but performed by somebody external to the group.

### Quality Test
#### External
These kind of tests is aimed at ensuring a good experience while playing the game. These will be performed by an external person of the group, in order to have an impartial opinion about the game.
The total duration of these tests is the same as QA tests, but the tester is only required for the first 30 minutes.
Quality tests will be made following the structure presented:
First part 30'(External tester required):
- Presentation
- Pre testing questions
- Playtest session
- Post testing questions

Second Part 30'(External tester not required, but useful to give more opinions to take into account):
- Recopilation of all the information got
- Team discussion
- Task distribution
