## Art used 

The art of our game is from Mindustry, we have the permission of his creator, while we do not use it for commercial use.
We also have some isometric sprites to some dungeons, this include, tilesets, monsters and structures

## Graphics

The graphics of our game are smooth and simple, in orthogonal, this will make the player having more control of the map and vision of what is happening,
the orthogonal map let to the players having a feeling of confortability.
On the other hand, the isometric sprites are more likely classic, we want to make it more dark, to inmerge the player into a real dungeon with monsters to complete the objective.
