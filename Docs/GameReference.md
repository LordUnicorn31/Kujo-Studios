# Game reference

## Comparisons

The game is heavily influenced by RTS like [They are Billions](https://store.steampowered.com/app/644930/They_Are_Billions/) or [Age of Empires](https://www.ageofempires.com/).

Once we knew the similarities between a bunch of RTS games, we started noting all the differences. Once we had that, we set a theme and our game's pillars.

The theme would be space, and the game would consist about developing your base in an unknown planet just to find out you're not alone, and gathering all the resources necessary to build a rocket to escape that planet.

Searching for similar RTS, we found a game called [Mindustry](https://anuke.itch.io/mindustry), which we found had many similarities with our game. Contacting the developer, we got his permission to use all the game's sprites to make our game.
