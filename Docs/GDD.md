# Game pillars

This game has 3 main game pillars:

Exploration: The player is meant to explore all the map and discover all the places the player can acces too. At some points of the game the player will be forced to go to specific areas of the map to do side quests.

Strategy: Strategy is the most important pillar in any RTS game and so it is in this game too. This game is much more about using the brain and knowing what to do in each moment than having great physical skills.

Mining & farming: Thbis game has the intention of having to farm and mine the map in order to be able to increase your base and units to be able to reach the main goal of the game.


# Story

In order to escape you will need to gather resources from the planet and build a new starship that helps you get out of that planet. But be careful! the population of the planet have discovered you, and they don't like the idea of having a bunch of strangers raiding their planet and stealing their ores, so you better protect yourself in order to achieve your main goal.
