# Game pillars

This game has 3 main game pillars:

Exploration: The player is meant to explore all the map and discover all the places the player can acces too. At some points of the game the player will be forced to go to specific areas of the map to do side quests.

Strategy: Strategy is the most important pillar in any RTS game and so it is in this game too. This game is much more about using the brain and knowing what to do in each moment than having great physical skills.

Mining & farming: Thbis game has the intention of having to farm and mine the map in order to be able to increase your base and units to be able to reach the main goal of the game.
