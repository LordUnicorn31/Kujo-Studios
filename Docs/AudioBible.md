## Audio Pillars
We are creating an RTS game, our audio pillars will focus in 3 important things.
- Constant enemy danger
- Map explorarion to obtain new resources
- Space theme 

## Music


## Effects


## Voice Over - Dialog
Right now we are not sure who the voice over is coming from (Girl, Boy, body type)
- Applied in the tutorial 
- Character dialogs in user orders.

## Technology
We don't know how we are going to handle audio.

.Ogg for music and .Wav for effects 

## Tools
We don't really know which programs are we going to use yet.
But we are going to use free sounds
